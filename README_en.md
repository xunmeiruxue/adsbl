<h2 id="a">üìî Introduction</h2>

This project aims to aggregate ad filtering rules from different sources and in various formats, allowing for flexible
conversion and integration.
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The new version is not compatible with the original configuration format, so please be cautious before
> migrating.

#### Supported Rule Formats 

- [x] easylist
- [x] dnsmasq
- [x] clash
- [x] smartdns
- [x] hosts

#### Important Notes 

1. Only basic rule conversions are supported, specifically rules consisting of domain names and wildcard domains. Rules
   such as `||example.org^$popup` cannot be converted (merging and deduplication are not affected). 
2. Accept unavoidable limitations. For example, `||example.org^` will block example.org and all its subdomains, but when
   converted to hosts format, it will not match subdomains. 
3. Rule validity check is based on domain resolution, so it only supports basic rules.

<h2 id="b">üõ†Ô∏è Quick Start</h2>

### Example Configuration

```yaml
application:
  rule:
    # Remote rule subscription, path is http/https address
    remote:
      - name: 'Subscription 1'               # Optional parameter: Rule name, if no name is provided, the path will be used as the name.
        path: 'https://example.org/rule.txt' # Required parameter: Rule url. Only support http/https. 
        type: easylist                      # Optional parameter: Rule type: easylist (default)„ÄÅdnsmasq„ÄÅclash„ÄÅsmartdns„ÄÅhosts

    # Local rule, path is absolute or relative path
    local:
      - name: 'private rule'
        path: '/rule/private.txt'

  output:
    # File header configuration, which will be automatically added as comments at the beginning of each rule file.
    # You can use placeholders like ${name}, ${type}, ${desc}, and ${date} (current date).
    file_header: |
      ADFS Adblock List
      Title: ${name}
      Last Modified: ${date}
      Homepage: https://github.com/fordes123/ad-filters-subscriber/
    files:
      - name: easylist.txt     # Required parameter: File name
        type: EASYLIST         # Required parameter: File type: easylist„ÄÅdnsmasq„ÄÅclash„ÄÅsmartdns„ÄÅhosts
        desc: 'ADFS EasyList'  # Optional parameter: File description, which can be used within ${} in the file_header.
        filter:                # Optional parameter: Types of included rules, all selected by default.
          - basic              # Basic rules: Do not contain any control or matching symbols, can be converted to hosts.
          - wildcard           # Wildcard rules: Only use wildcard symbols.
          - unknown            # Other rules: Such as those using regex or advanced modifiers, cannot be converted at present.
```

This program is written in `Java 21` and built using `Maven`. You can refer to the [example configuration](./config/application-example.yaml),
edit `config/application.yaml`, and quickly get started using any of the following methods:

#### **Local Debugging**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fordes123/ad-filters-subscriber.git
cd ad-filters-subscriber
mvn clean
mvn spring-boot:run
```

#### **Github Action**

- Fork this project
- Customize rule subscriptions
    - Refer to the [example configuration](./config/application-example.yaml) and modify the configuration file: `config/application.yaml`
- Open the GitHub Actions page, select Update Filters on the left side, and authorize the workflow for scheduled
  execution (‚ö† important step)
- Click Run workflow or wait for automatic execution. Once completed, the corresponding rules will be generated in the
  directory specified in the configuration.

#### **Codespaces**

- Log in to `GitHub`, click the `Code` button in the upper right corner of this repository, and select and create a
  new `Codespace`.
- Wait for `Codespaces` to start, and you can directly debug this project.
